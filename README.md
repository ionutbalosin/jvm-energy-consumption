## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assess the energy consumption across multiple JVMs distributions while running different custom-made Java programs and off-the-shelf applications (e.g., including [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) web-based).

It is not a goal to compare the energy consumption across different frameworks (since the code is different there won't be an apples-to-apples comparison), but keeping the same application and just changing the runtime (or the JVM) check the new energy consumption.

## Methodology

To measure energy consumption, Intelâ€™s Running Average Power Limit (**RAPL**) interface is used. 
RAPL provides power-limiting features and accurate energy readings for several power domains. For each supported power domain, a Machine Specific Register (MSR) filled with a 32-bit integer is exposed and updated at intervals of approximately 1 millisecond.
The RAPL power domains:
- Package (PKG) domain measures the energy consumption of the entire socket. It includes the consumption of all the cores, integrated graphics and also the uncore components (last level caches, memory controller).
- Power Plane 0 (PP0) domain measures the energy consumption of all processor cores on the socket.
- Power Plane 1 (PP1) domain measures the energy consumption of processor graphics (GPU) on the socket (desktop models only).
- DRAM domain measures the energy consumption of random access memory (RAM) attached to the integrated memory controller.
- PSys domain introduced with Intel Skylake. It monitors and controls the thermal and power specifications of the entire SoC and it is useful especially when the source of the power consumption is neither the CPU nor the GPU. PSys includes the power consumption of the package domain, System Agent, PCH, eDRAM,and a few more domains on a single-socket SoC.

For multi-socket server systems, each socket reports its own RAPL values (for example, a two socket computing system has two separate PKG readings for both the packages, two separate PP0 readings, etc.).

Since the RAPL reports the entire energy of a host machine, it is important to minimize the load on the target machine and run only the application in charge. In addition, a baseline of the entire system (without any explicit load) should be measured.

While measuring the JVM energy consumption, it is important to have a realistic load (i.e., usage of the application) and to trigger as many endpoints as possible for a reasonable time interval, otherwise, the Gargabe Collector footprint or further Just-In-Time compiler optimizations are simply skipped and makes the measurements less relevant. Just starting and stopping the application is not an option. 

The command pattern used to start the JVM application that also reports at the end the energy stats rely on `perf` (available only on Linux):

```
$ perf stat -a \
   -e "power/energy-cores/" \
   -e "power/energy-gpu/" \
   -e "power/energy-pkg/" \
   -e "power/energy-psys/" \
   -e "power/energy-ram/" \
   <application_runner_path>
```

#### Load Test System Architecture

For some applications (e.g., Spring Boot and Quarkus web-based) load test scenarios must be conducted to collect the energy consumption.

The load testing tool should run on a different host than the target JVM application, otherwise, the energy measurements will be negatively impacted.

[![load-test-system-architecture.svg](./docs/load-test-system-architecture.svg?raw=true)](./docs/load-test-system-architecture.svg?raw=true)

On **system under test** runs only the target JVM application. 

On **system client test** runs the load testing tool (e.g., Hyperfoil) as well as any additional resource needed for the application (e.g., PostgreSQL database).

The network latency between the system under test and the system client test (i.e., round trip time) must be constant and neglectable, that's why a wired connection is preferred.

## Prerequisites

In order to properly run the scripts you need to:
- install `perf` on Linux
- download and install any JDK distribution (please see below the list of the recommended ones)
- download and install [Hyperfoil](https://hyperfoil.io) (i.e., a microservice-oriented distributed benchmark framework)

## Measurements

### Baseline Idle OS

This set of measurements captures the idle power consumption, and it is used to understand (and remove) the overhead of the hardware system:

```
$ cd /baseline-idle-os
$ sudo ./run-baseline.sh
```

### Java Samples

This set of measurements relies on specific code patterns to identify what is the most friendly energy coding paradigm. It includes the most common patterns as:

- logging patterns
- memory access patterns
- throwing exception patterns

```
$ cd /java-samples
$ sudo ./run-samples.sh
```

### Spring PetClinic Application

This set of measurements uses the off-the-shelf Spring PetClinic application.

1. Clone the repository [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) and build the sources
2. Open the [run-application.sh](./spring-petclinic/run-application.sh) script and update the variables `JAVA_HOME`, `APP_HOME`
2. Open the [run-hyperfoil.sh](./spring-petclinic/run-hyperfoil.sh) script and update the variable `HYPERFOIL_HOME`
3. Launch the JVM application on the **system under test**:

```
$ cd /spring-petclinic
$ sudo ./run-application.sh
```

4. After the application has successfully started, launch the Hyperfoil on the **system client test**:

```
$ cd /spring-petclinic
$ ./run-hyperfoil.sh
```

### Quarkus Hibernate ORM Panache Quickstart

This set of measurements uses the off-the-shelf Quarkus Hibernate ORM Panache quickstart.

2. Open the [run-application.sh](./quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache-quickstart/run-application.sh) script and update the variables `JAVA_HOME`, `APP_HOME`, `POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE`
3. Open the [run-hyperfoil.sh](./quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache-quickstart/run-hyperfoil.sh) script and update the variable `HYPERFOIL_HOME`
4. Launch the PostgreSQL database on the **system client test**:

```
$ cd /quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache-quickstart
