## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to assess the energy consumption across different JVMs distributions. 

It is not intented to compare the energy consumption across different frameworks (since the code is different there won't be an apples-to-apples comparison), but keeping the same application and just changing the runtime (or the JVM) check the new energy consumption.

Different off-the-shelf applications using different technologies are included to cover a spread spectrum of applications.

## Methodology

To measure energy consumption, Intelâ€™s Running Average Power Limit (**RAPL**) interface is used. RAPL provides power-limiting features and accurate energy readings for several domains, like Package, Core, Uncore, and DRAM. For each supported power domain, a Machine Specific Register (MSR) filled with a 32-bit integer is exposed and updated at intervals of approximately 1 millisecond.

Since the **RAPL** reports the entire energy of a host machine, it is important to minimize the load on the target machine and run only the application in charge. In addition, a baseline of the entire system (without any explicit load) should be measured.

While measuring the JVM energy consumption, it is important to have a realistic load (i.e., usage of the application) and to trigger as many endpoints as possible for a reasonable time interval, otherwise, the Gargabe Collector footprint or further Just-In-Time compiler optimizations are simply skipped and makes the measurements less relevant. Just starting and stopping the application is not an option.

#### Load Test System Architecture

The load testing tool should run on a different host than the target JVM application, otherwise, the energy measurements will be negatively impacted.

[![load-test-system-architecture.svg](./docs/load-test-system-architecture.svg?raw=true)](./docs/load-test-system-architecture.svg?raw=true)

On **system under test** runs only the target JVM application. The command pattern used to start it that also reports at the end the energy stats rely on `perf`:

```
$ perf stat -a \
   -e "power/energy-cores/" \
   -e "power/energy-gpu/" \
   -e "power/energy-pkg/" \
   -e "power/energy-psys/" \
   -e "power/energy-ram/" \
   <application_runner_path>
```

On **system client test** runs the load testing tool (e.g., JMeter or Hyperfoil) as well as any additional resource needed for the application (e.g., PostgreSQL database).

The network latency between the system under test and the system client test (i.e., round trip time) must be constant and neglectable, that's why a wired connection is preferred.

## Prerequisites

In order to properly run the scripts you need to:
- install `perf` on Linux
- download and install any JDK (you could also use [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/install))
- download and install [Hyperfoil](https://hyperfoil.io)
- download and install [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi), including a few plugins. These plugins are needed to generate the plots, after each load test:
    - [Command-Line Graph Plotting Tool](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/JMeterPluginsCMD)
    - [Filter Results Tool](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/FilterResultsTool)
    - [Synthesis Report](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/SynthesisReport)
    - [Response Times Over Time](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/ResponseTimesOverTime)
    - [Response Times vs Threads](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/ResponseTimesVsThreads)
    - [Response Times Distribution](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/RespTimesDistribution)

Some tests use **Hyperfoil** and others use **JMeter** (due to historical reasons) but this is not so important regarding our goal (i.e., measuring the JVM energy consumption).

> **JMeter**: if the number of threads is not properly chosen, the [Coordinated Omission](https://groups.google.com/g/mechanical-sympathy/c/icNZJejUHfE) problem might cause inaccurate results. Please have a look at [JMeter best practices](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/best-practices.html).

## Measurements

### Spring PetClinic Application

1. Clone the repository [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) and build the sources
2. Open the [run-application.sh](./spring-petclinic/run-application.sh) script and update the mandatory variables `JAVA_HOME`, `APP_HOME`
2. Open the [run-jmeter.sh](./spring-petclinic/run-jmeter.sh) script and update the mandatory variable `JMETER_HOME`
3. Launch the JVM application on the **system under test**:

```
$ cd /spring-petclinic
$ sudo ./run-application.sh
```

4. After the application has successfully started, launch the JMeter on the **system client test**:

```
$ cd /spring-petclinic
$ sudo ./run-jmeter.sh
```

**Notes**:
- `sudo` mode is needed, otherwise the tests will not be executed

### Renaissance Benchmark Suite

3. Launch the benchmarks:

```
$ cd /renaissance
$ sudo ./run-benchmarks.sh
```

**Notes**:
- `sudo` mode is needed, otherwise the benchmarks will not be executed

### Quarkus Hibernate ORM Panache Quickstart


1. Clone the repository [quarkus-quickstarts](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts) and build the **hibernate-orm-panache-quickstart** sources
